                <p>In consideration of being permitted to attend Devoxx, organised by The Java Community BVBA (“Devoxx”), and on behalf of myself (collectively “Participant”), I hereby:</p>

                <p>1. Agree to indemnify and save and hold the The Java Community BVBA, their employees, volunteers, partners and sponsors (collectively "Devoxx")
                    harmless from any liability, loss, damage or cost that may occur or be incurred due to the Participants' participation in Devoxx; </p>

                <p>2. Release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue Devoxx from all liability to Participants for any loss or damages, and any
                    claim or demands on account of injury to or resulting in death of Participants, whether caused by the negligence of Devoxx or of
                    any other person; </p>

                <p>3. Assume full responsibility for and risk of bodily injury or death, whether due to the negligence of Devoxx or otherwise. I
                    expressly acknowledge and understand that accidents may occur while at Devoxx and expressly assume all of the risks due to the
                    negligence of Devoxx and any others participating or contributing to Devoxx; </p>

                <p>4. Expressly agree, permit and assume the risk of any medical treatment which may be rendered and agree to expressly
                    release and indemnify Devoxx from any liability for providing, or failing to provide, any emergency medical treatment.</p>

                <p>5. I understand that I am solely responsible for the welfare and safety of myself to Devoxx Events, I further understand that Devoxx
                    will not provide insurance for Participants at Devoxx Events, and that Participants' personal insurance will apply.</p>

                <p>6. I agree to help encourage a safe and respectful atmosphere at Devoxx Events. I agree to refrain from engaging in illegal
                    activities of any kind, and I understand that I am solely responsible for the activities of myself at Devoxx Events. </p>

                <p>7. I understand that Participants often take photos and movies during Devoxx Events and I agree that these photos and movies may be
                    used on the Devoxx and Parleys website, on related websites, and in Devoxx publications. I further expressly agree that the foregoing
                    release, waiver, and indemnity agreement is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the Belgian law, and that if any portion thereof
                    is held invalid, it is agreed that the balance shall, notwithstanding, continue in full legal force and effect.</p>

                <p>I have read, fully understood its content and voluntarily and automatically comply with this release, waiver, and indemnity agreement when registering for Devoxx.
                    I further agree that no oral representations, statements, or inducement apart from the foregoing online agreement have been made.</p>
